I am currently a postdoc at KIT, within the [KleinLab](https://kleinlab-statml.github.io/) under the supervision of [Nadja Klein](https://www.scc.kit.edu/personen/nadja.klein.php).
I am PhD candidate in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University (Milan) and I will defend my dissertation in January.
During my PhD I have worked on the developement of Bayesian models for complex mortality data under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/) (Bocconi University) and co-supervision of [Emanuele Aliverti](https://emanuelealiverti.github.io/) (University of Padova).

You can contact me at [giovanni.romano@kit.edu](mailto:giovanni.romano@kit.edu) or [giovanni.romano4@phd.unibocconi.it](mailto:giovanni.romano4@phd.unibocconi.it).

You can find me in room 364 of the 20.20 building (Zirkel 2, 76131 Karlsruhe).

## Ongoning research projects

- _Dependent stochastic block models for age-indexed sequences of directed causes-of-death networks._ with Castiglione C., Durante, D. \[submitted, see [pubblications](https://giovanni-romano.github.io/publications/)\]
- _Bayesian local clustering of age-period mortality surfaces across multiple countries_.  with Aliverti E., Durante D. \[submitted, see [pubblications](https://giovanni-romano.github.io/publications/)\]
