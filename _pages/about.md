I am currently a 4th year PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University, Milan.
I'm currently working on the developement of Bayesian models for complex real-world data under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/) (Bocconi University) and co-supervision of [Emanuele Aliverti](https://emanuelealiverti.github.io/) (University of Padova).

You can contact me at [giovanni.romano4@phd.unibocconi.it](mailto:giovanni.romano4@phd.unibocconi.it).

You can find me in the Office 3-E2-07 in the Grafton Building (via Rontgen 1, Milan, 20136).

## Ongoning research projects
- _Dynamic clustering of country-specific log-mortality rates via random partition models on B-splines expansions._ with Aliverti, E., Durante, D.
- _Dependent stochastic block-models for sequences of networks, with application to USA causes of death._ with Castiglione C., Durante, D.
