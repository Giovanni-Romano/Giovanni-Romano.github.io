I am currently a 4th year PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University, Milan.
I'm currently working on developing Bayesian models for complex real-world data under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/) (Bocconi University) and co-supervision of [Emanuele Aliverti](https://emanuelealiverti.github.io/) (Padua University).

You can contact me at [giovanni.romano4@phd.unibocconi.it](mailto:giovanni.romano4@phd.unibocconi.it).

You can find me in the Office 3-e2-07 in the Grafton Building (via Rontgen 1, Milan, 20136).

## Ongoning research projects

- _Dependent extended stochastic block-models for sequences of networks indexed by a predictor._ Romanò, G., Castiglione C., Durante, D.
